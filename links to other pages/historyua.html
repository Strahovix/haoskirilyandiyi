    <h2>Ancient History</h2>
    <p>The territory of modern Ukraine has been inhabited since 32,000 BC. During the 8th-3rd centuries BC, the Cimmerians, Scythians, and Sarmatians roamed the territory, leaving behind numerous burial mounds.</p>
    <h2>Medieval History</h2>
    <p>In the Middle Ages, Ukraine was part of the Kyivan Rus, the first East Slavic state. In the 13th century, the Mongols invaded and destroyed Kyivan Rus, leaving Ukraine divided among various principalities.</p>
    <h2>Modern History</h2>
    <p>In the 16th century, Ukraine came under the control of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In the late 18th century, Ukraine was partitioned between the Russian Empire and the Austrian Empire. In 1917, Ukraine declared independence, but was soon occupied by Soviet Russia.</p>
    <h2>Recent History</h2>
    <p>In 1991, Ukraine declared independence from the Soviet Union and became a sovereign nation. Since then, Ukraine has faced numerous challenges, including economic instability, political corruption, and military conflict in the east of the country.</p><br>
